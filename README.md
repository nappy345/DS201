Business Understanding

In the modern era of the NBA, the trend of high-scoring offense has become a staple of the game. Today, teams use a variety of strategies to score points, from fast-paced drives to the basket to long-range three-pointers. Teams like the Golden State Warriors and Houston Rockets have been able to dominate the league by utilizing their offensive talents. The Warriors, for example, broke the record for the most three-pointers in a single season, while the Rockets have used their potent long-range shooting to become one of the most prolific scoring teams in the league. Point scoring and offense are vital to success in the NBA, and the teams that utilize these skills to their advantage are generally the ones that win titles. By focusing on offensive basketball, teams can generate points and build a strong foundation of success. Furthermore, as the NBA continues to evolve, so too must the strategies and skills of its teams, making point scoring and offense essential components of winning basketball.

The offensive rating of an NBA team is a measure of their overall offensive production. This rating takes into account the quality of the shots taken, the pace of the game, the offensive efficiency, and other factors. By examining an NBA team's offensive rating, one can gain an understanding of how well they are producing on the offensive end. As such, the offensive rating of a team can have a substantial effect on the team's overall winning percentage. When teams have a higher offensive rating, they tend to score more points and win more games. Teams with a higher offensive rating also tend to have a better field goal percentage, which gives them an edge in close games. It also helps them spread the defense out, creating more scoring opportunities. Ultimately, having a higher offensive rating allows teams to outscore their opponents more often, resulting in an improved win-loss record. On the other hand, teams with a lower offensive rating tend to struggle more in close games and lack the necessary scoring output to pull out a victory. Low offensive ratings can also make it more difficult for teams to establish a consistent offensive identity, leading to less effective offensive execution. Overall, the offensive rating of an NBA team has a significant impact on their winning percentage. Thus, it is essential for teams to strive for an optimal offensive rating in order to maximize their chances of victory.

This project places a focus on analyzing the relationship between teams' offensive ratings and defensive ratings and their win-loss percentage. Regressing these two variables will reveal if highly offensive teams do in fact see more success in the NBA. By reseacrhing the effects of defensive rating on win-loss percentage, we will be able to further confirm our hypothesis that the NBA has become more centered around offensive success.

Data Understanding
Our data came from Basketball Reference, which is a website that contains massive database of statistics from the NBA (formerly the ABA), G-League, NBL ,international leagues, and WNBA. We utilized their database to access team statistics for the seasons of 2011-2012 through 2021-2022.

Our Variables:

Rk -- Rank

WIN -- Wins

LOSS -- Losses

W/L% -- Win-Loss Percentage (This will be our dependent variabel)

MARGIN -- Margin of Victory

OFFR -- Offensive Rating -- An estimate of points produced (players) or scored (teams) per 100 possessions

DEFR -- Defensive Rating -- An estimate of points allowed per 100 possessions

NETR -- Net Rating; an estimate of point differential per 100 possessions.

MOV/A -- Adjusted Margin of Victory; margin of victory adjusted for strength of opponent.

ORtg/A -- Adjusted Offensive Rating -- An estimate of points scored per 100 possessions adjusted for strength of opponent defense.

DRtg/A -- Adjusted Defensive Rating -- An estimate of points allowed per 100 possessions adjusted for strength of opponent offense.

NRtg/A -- Adjusted Net Rating; an estimate of point differential per 100 possessions adjusted for strength of opponent.

When it comes to basketball, NBA teams understand that a dominant offense is the key to team success. When teams have an efficient offense, they can score points in bunches and create a larger margin of error on the defensive end. Offensive rating measures a team’s total offensive efficiency, taking into account all of the possessions that a team has to work with. On the other hand, defensive rating is a measure of a team’s defensive efficiency, taking into account all of the possessions that a team has to defend against.

The research provided in this project concluded that teams are devoted to having a high offensive rating because it gives them the best chance to win games. A team with a high offensive rating is usually able to establish a lead in the game and then maintain it by scoring points with ease. It also opens up opportunities for transition plays and fast breaks that can put points up on the board quickly and efficiently. The ability to score points quickly can also mean that a team does not have to rely on long possessions and can instead capitalize on shorter ones to rack up points. The data revealed that teams who run a surperior offense are almost always one of the best teams in the NBA.

In contrast, NBA teams do not generally care about having a low defensive rating. While having a great defensive rating may reduce the amount of points that the opposition scores, it does not always guarantee victory. It is very possible for a team to win games despite having a poor defensive rating. This is because a team can still score more points than the opposition, even if they do not defend as well. Ultimately, it is clear that offense is more important to NBA teams than defense, as a high offensive rating gives them the best chance of winning games, while a higher defensive rating coincides with a lower Win/Loss percentage.
